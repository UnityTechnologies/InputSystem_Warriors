## Overview

**Description**

This Unity example project has been created to demonstrate a variety of tools and functionality with Unity's Input System.

You can learn more about the Input System here: https://unity.com/features/input-system


**Input System Demonstrated Scenarios**
- Input Action Control Scheme for basic Player Controls (Directional Axis for Movement, Button press for Attack)
- Setting up Keyboard and Generic Gamepad bindings to the Control Scheme
  - Tested with the follwing controllers: PlayStation Dualshock 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch Pro
- Instancing multiple Player Controllers for a local multiplayer setup
- UI Input (Virtual Joystick and Virtual Button) for Touchscreen Controls
- Runtime switching between Player Control and Menu Control Action Maps
- UI for rebinding action controls to new buttons and joysticks
- Displaying connected device data in both Screen Space and World Space UI
- Callbacks for an Input Device runtime disconnecting and reconnecting

**Other Demonstrated Scenarios**
- Universal Render Pipeline's Camera Stacking for Overlay UI
- Universal Render Pipeline's Scriptable Render Pass for Scene Blur UI Overlay
- Universal Render Pipeline's Integrated Post-Processing for Tonemapping
- Nested UI Prefab for Displaying Input Device Information
- Shader Graph for filtering a Mask Map for Team Colors
- TextMesh Pro for rendering Screen Space and World Space UI Text
- Scriptable Object for storing Device Display Colors and Display Names

## Technical Disclaimers & Known Issues

- The GameManager script has a toggle for spawning a group of Warriors at Runtime.
  - The number of warriors that is spawned is based on a fixed integer variable (manually set in the Inspector), and is not based on the number of input devices connected and detected.

- When opening the project for the first time, the **Pause Menu Screen Blur Effect** might not be rendering.
  - To fix this, locate the **UniversalRenderPipeline_Renderer_MenuBlur** asset and add the **Kawase Blur Render Pass** to the Renderer Features
